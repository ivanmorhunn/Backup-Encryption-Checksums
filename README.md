<h1>Backup-Encryption-Checksums</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This is my semester project that I have with my CYBER 262. Our goal was to create a script that does certain things such as backing up files, encrypting files and checking their hash value.

<h2>Requirements<h2>
 
 - <b>Backups are generated via Windows .bat file</b>
 - <b>Once the backup is generated, the file needs to be named with the site that generated it and the date in YYYYMMDD format</b>
 - <b>Then the file needs to be compressed and encrypted</b>
 - <b>An additional .bat file is needed to decrypt and decompress the file when a database restore is necessary</b>
 - <b>Another .bat file is needed to create a checksum (hash) for verification that any file run through it is unchanged and youâ€™ll need to demonstrate that the hash works by modifying the file</b>
